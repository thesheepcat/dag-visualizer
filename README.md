# dag-visualizer

How to run the DAG visualizer: 
1. Load DAG information in nodeList.json (in server folder)

2. With two terminals, open both folders, as they're two separated projects:
-   dag-visualizer-server
-   dag-visualizer-client

3. Install relevant libraries and run the server by executing these commands in the dag-visualizer-server folder:
-   npm install
-   npm start

4. Install relevant libraries and run the client by executing these commands in the dag-visualizer-client folder:
-   npm install
-   npm install parcel
-   npm run build

5. You'll find the DAG  visualization on localhost:1234
